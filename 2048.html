<h4>
    2048
</h4>
<p>
    I am still learning a lot about AI. I am currently developing a reinforcement
    learning algorithm to solve a time killing game, called 2048, as quickly and 
    effectively as possible. I am developing this project currently in Google Colab,
    but when the AI passes all of the debugging tests, I will run it locally, on my
    computer.
