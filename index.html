            I am a freshman at Sacred Heart, Atherton, which I have been attending
            for nine years.

            I am fluent in Python, and I am learning machine learning for fun.

        <p>
            I am still learning a lot about AI. I am currently developing a reinforcement
            learning algorithm to solve a time killing game, called 2048, as quickly and 
            effectively as possible. I am developing this project currently in Google Colab,
            but when the AI passes all of the debugging tests, I will run it locally, on my
            computer.
