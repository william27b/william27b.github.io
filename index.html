        About Me
    </h2>
    <p>
        I love to learn! I am especially interested programming and
        Artificial Intelligence, and I am currently reading the MIT
        textbook on computer science and the Stanford textbook on computer
        systems.

    <h2>
        My Experiences
    </h2>
    <p>
        I am a freshman highschooler, currently attending Sacred Heart Prep, Atherton.
        I am in the robotics club, and last year (as an eigth grader), my team has progressed
        further than any other Sacred Heart Middle School team.

        2048
    </h4>
    <p>
        I am still learning a lot about AI. I am currently developing a reinforcement
        learning algorithm to solve a time killing game, called 2048, as quickly and 
        effectively as possible. I am developing this project currently in Google Colab,
        but when the AI passes all of the debugging tests, I will run it locally, on my
        computer.
